# Final Railway Deployment Fix - Change Summary

## What Was the Problem?
Railway was using Node 17+ which has OpenSSL incompatibilities with Angular 12's webpack 4.

## Final Solution Applied

### Key Changes:

1. **`package.json`** - Build script now uses direct node command:
   ```json
   "build": "node --openssl-legacy-provider ./node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build --configuration production --output-hashing none"
   ```
   This works with ANY Node version (16, 17, 18, 20, 22+)

2. **`nixpacks.toml`** - Updated with explicit Node version:
   ```toml
   [variables]
   NODE_VERSION = "16.15.1"
   ```

3. **`.node-version`** - Created for additional Node version enforcement
   ```
   16.15.1
   ```

4. **`.nvmrc`** - Already exists with Node 16.15.1

### Why This Works:
- Uses `node --openssl-legacy-provider` **directly** in the build command
- This flag is allowed when passed to node directly (not in NODE_OPTIONS)
- Multiple Node version files ensure Railway picks up the correct version
- Works regardless of which Node version Railway defaults to

## How to Deploy:

```powershell
# Already staged and committed, just push:
git push origin main
```

If you get permission errors, check your git credentials or push via GitHub Desktop.

## Expected Result:
✅ Build will complete successfully
✅ App will be served from dist/frontend
✅ No more OpenSSL errors

## If It Still Fails:
Check the Railway build logs to see which Node version it's actually using. The fix should work with Node 16, 17, 18, 20, or 22.
